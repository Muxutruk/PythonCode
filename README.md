# Readme not important
This proyect is simply python code that has to do with math. It is very-very simple, it is my personal proyect but i'd like to have some contributors

dx.py evaluates the derivate of a function, by default,f(x) = ln(x), on the points from 1 to 9. Change the first function to the function you want to evaluate

integral.py evaluates the definite integral of the first function, by default, f(x) = x, from 1 to 2. Change the first function to the function you want to evaluate

lines.py has various utilites, here's a tutorial for each:

```
PointAndSlope((X,Y), SLOPE), input: Point and slope, output: Equation
TwoPoints((X1,Y1),(X2,Y2)), input: Two points, output: Equation
FindRoot(SLOPE,COSTANT), input: Equation, output: Root/Xintercept
Slopeprint(SLOPE,COSTANT), input: Equation, output: Evaluation from -3 to 3
```

And finally, miscallenous.py has three functions, the only thing to change is the lower part, the printing side
```
factorial(INT>0), returs the product of all integers below it, for example, 20! = 1*2*3*4*5...19*20
fibbonaci(INT>0), return the nth fibbonaci number, the first and the second being 1
factors(INT>0), returs all the factors of the number
```
